# 🌌 Sorting Algorithm Race Visualizer

An interactive, neon-themed web application that visually compares how
multiple sorting algorithms operate on the same input data side by side.

Built with **Python**, **Matplotlib**, and **Streamlit**.

---

## ✨ Features
- Compare **6 sorting algorithms simultaneously**
- Neon-on-dark visual theme
- Pastel comparison highlights
- Live **leaderboard** showing which algorithm finishes first
- User-provided input via web interface
- Displays original and sorted output

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Included
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

---

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

## 🎓 Why This Project
This project was built to deepen understanding of algorithmic behavior by
visually comparing classic sorting algorithms under identical conditions,
with an emphasis on clarity, usability, and design.
